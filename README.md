# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis

Used Amazon reviews dataset from https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/.

**Project Overview**

This project explores sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews, with a focus on transforming unstructured text into actionable insights. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, reviews were preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized to uncover sentiment patterns and trends that reflect customer perceptions.

**Methodology**

Sentiment labels were generated and validated by combining VADER polarity scores with user ratings, creating a reliable foundation for supervised machine learning tasks. The models were iteratively trained and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization and precisionâ€“recall threshold adjustments, ensuring that both accuracy and real-world applicability were addressed.

**Results**

The final machine learning models achieved an F1 score of 90%, while also delivering a 30% reduction in false positives, a critical improvement for practical deployment of sentiment classification systems. The project highlights how advanced NLP techniques and thoughtful model design can transform raw text data into meaningful signals for businesses seeking to better understand customer feedback.
